# Mystery Word

Mystery_word is a ruby program of a classic hangman game, giving the players the choice of easy (4 - 6 letter words), normal (6 - 8 letters) or hard (> 8 letters).

The requirements of this assignment are the following:

The computer must select a word at random from the list of words in the file /usr/share/dict/wor

-The user choose a level of difficulty at the beginning of the program. Easy mode only has words of 4-6 characters; normal mode only has words of 6-8 characters; hard mode only has words of 8+ characters.

-At the start of the game, the user know should be told how many letters the computer's word contains.

-One guess is allowed per round. This letter can be upper or lower case and it does not matter. If a user enters more than one letter, tell them the input is invalid and let them try again.

-The user should be informed if their guess appears in the computer's word.

The computer should display the partially guessed word, as well as letters that have not been guessed.
